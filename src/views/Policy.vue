            that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive
            information about what you post or share. Information collected by

          </p>
          <h6>Sharing with third-party partners</h6>
          <p>
            We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve
            our Services or who use Nzukoor to grow their businesses, which
            makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services
            to people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to
            anyone and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how
            our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the
            types of third parties that we share information with:
          </p>
          <h6>Partners who use our analytics services.</h6>
          <p>
            We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and
            businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts,
            listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Nzukoor
            Platform. For example, Page admins and Nzukoor business profiles
            receive information about the number of people or accounts who
            viewed, reacted to or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate
            demographic and other information that helps them understand
            interactions with their Page or account.
          </p>
          <h6>Advertisers.</h6>
          <p>
            We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing
            their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share
            information that personally identifies you (information such as your
            name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or
            identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example,
            we provide general demographic and interest information to
            advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the
            ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Ghana and likes software engineering)
            to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which
            Nzukoor ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an
            advertiser.
          </p>
          <h6>Device and Connection Information.</h6>

            operating system information, browser information, IP address,
            mobile network information including phone number, and device
            identifiers. We collect device location information if you use our
            location features, such as when you choose to share your location
            with your contacts, view locations nearby or those others have
            shared with you, and the like, and for diagnostics and
            troubleshooting purposes such as if you are having trouble with our
            app’s location features.
          </p>
          <h6>Researchers and academics.</h6>
          <p>
            We also provide information and content to research partners and
            academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and
            innovation that supports our business mission of helping people find
            fulfillment in their day-to-day lives by connecting them to people,
            knowledge and opportunities.

          </p>
          <p>
            Our measures include implementing appropriate access controls,
            investing in the latest Information Security Capabilities to protect
            the IT environments we leverage, and ensuring we encrypt,
            pseudonymise and anonymise personal data wherever possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access to your personal data is only permitted among our employees
            and agents on a need-to-know basis and subject to strict contractual
            confidentiality obligations when processed by third-parties.
          </p>
          <h6>What are your rights?</h6>
          <p>
            Your rights in relation to your personal data, how it is processed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where we process your personal data, you have a number of rights
            over how the data is processed and can exercise these rights at any
            point. We have provided an overview of these rights below together
            with what this entails for you. You can exercise your rights by

              The right to be informed. You have the right to be provided with
              clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how
              we use your personal data and your rights. Therefore, we’re
              providing you with the information in this Notice.
            </li>
            <li>
              The right to access and rectification. You have the right to
              access, correct or update your personal data at any time. We
              understand the importance of this and should you want to exercise
              your rights, please contact us.
            </li>
            <li>
              The right to data portability. The personal data you have provided
              us with is portable. This means it can be moved, copied or
              transmitted electronically under certain circumstances.
            </li>
            <li>
              The right to be forgotten. Under certain circumstances, you have
              right to request that we delete your data. If you wish to delete
              the personal data we hold about you, please let us know and we
              will take reasonable steps to respond to your request in
              accordance with legal requirements. If the personal data we
              collect is no longer needed for any purposes and we are not
              required by law to retain it, we will do what we can to delete,
              destroy or permanently de-identify it.
            </li>
            <li>
              The right to object. Under certain circumstances, you have the
              right to object to certain types of processing, including
              processing for direct marketing (i.e., receiving emails from us
              notifying you or being contacted with varying potential
              opportunities).
            </li>
            <li>
              The right to lodge a complaint with a Supervisory Authority. You
              have the right to lodge a complaint directly with any local
              Supervisory Authority about how we process your personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
              The right to withdraw consent. If you have given your consent to
              anything we do with your personal data (i.e., we rely on consent
              as a legal basis for processing your personal data), you have the
              right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so,
              it does not mean that anything we have done with your personal
              data with your consent up to that point is unlawful). You can
              withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data at
              any time by contacting us with the details provided below.
            </li>

            <li>
              Rights related to automated decision-making. You have the right
              not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated
              processing and which produces legal or other significant effects
              on you. In particular, you have the right:
              <ul>
                <li>to obtain human intervention;</li>
                <li>to express your point of view;</li>
                <li>
                  to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after an
                  assessment; and
                </li>
                <li>to challenge such a decision.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h6>How can I manage or delete information about me?</h6>
          <p>
            We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and delete
            your data.
          </p>
          <p>
            We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our
            services or until your account is deleted – whichever comes first.
            This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as
            the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and
            relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you
            search for something on Nzukoor, you can access and delete that
            query from within your search history at any time, but the log of
            that search is deleted after six months. If you submit a copy of
            your valid photo ID for account verification purposes, we delete
            that copy 30 days after submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you delete your account, we delete things that you have posted,
            and you won't be able to recover this information later. Information
            that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and
            won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want
            to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your
            account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit
            your Nzukoor profile.
          </p>
          <h6>Law And Protection</h6>
          <p>
            We may collect, use, preserve, and share your information if we have
            a good-faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond
            pursuant to applicable law or regulations, to legal process, or to
            government requests; (b) enforce our Terms and any other applicable
            terms and policies, including for investigations of potential
            violations; (c) detect, investigate, prevent, and address fraud and
            other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or (d)
            protect the rights, property, and safety of our users, or others.
          </p>
          <h6>How will we notify you of changes to this Policy?</h6>
          <p>
            We'll notify you before we make changes to this Policy and give you
            the opportunity to review the revised Policy before you choose to
            continue using our Products.
